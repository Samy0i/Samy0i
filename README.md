### 🧠 About Me

Hi, I’m **Shahriar Shadman Samy**, an 18-year-old **Full-Stack Developer** and **Co-Founder & CTO at [Propilist](https://propilist.com)** — a modern real estate SaaS platform built with Next.js. I’m currently studying **Electrical Engineering** and constantly exploring new technologies.

My coding journey began at 14, when I started creating **Minecraft mods**, which led me to experiment with **Python** and build small projects. At 16, I got my first PC and quickly fell in love with **JavaScript** and **React**, which opened the door to full-stack development.

Since then, I’ve built everything from **school projects with Astro and React** to **large-scale apps** like an Apple website clone, an **anime streaming platform**, and now **Propilist**.

I’m more of a developer than a designer — but I love great design. Whenever I see a beautifully crafted site, I can’t resist the urge to rebuild it just to understand how it works.
